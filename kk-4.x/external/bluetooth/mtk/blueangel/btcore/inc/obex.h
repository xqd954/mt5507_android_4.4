 * Section: Object Store API functions
 *
 ****************************************************************************
 *
 *     The Object Store component provides the interface through which the
 *     Command Interpreter can store and retrieve objects. It is viewed by
 *     the OBEX Protocol Layer as a part of the application framework. This
 *     system dependent component presents a well-defined interface to the
 *     Command Interpreter and some internal interfaces for the application's
 *     use. This chapter describes the three Object Store functions that are
 *     required for the OBEX Protocol Layer. For a discussion of the Object
 *     Store functions and structures used internally by the application refer
 *     to the Example Object Store in the Writing OBEX Applications chapter
 *     of the OBEX Developer's Guide document.
 *
 *     The required Object Store functions are prototyped in the obex.h
 *     include file. These functions are linked to each Obex Server and Client
 *     through the ObStoreFuncTable defined by the Object Store.  The Object
 *     Store names for these functions are irrelevant, but the parameters must
 *     match those of the function prototypes defined below.
 *
 *     OBEX version 3.1 introduces a fourth function call that is required
 *     only when OBEX_DYNAMIC_OBJECT_SUPPORT is enabled. This function,
 *     OBS_ReadFlex() is used instead of OBS_Read() when reading
 *     objects whose exact size is not known at the start of the operation.
 *     The protocol will automatically switch to calling Read Flex instead
 *     of Read when the OBS_GetObjectLen() function returns the constant
 *     UNKNOWN_OBJECT_LENGTH. It is recommended that this method only be used
 *     when necessary, because it reduces the transmit efficiency of the OBEX
 *     protocol. However, for small objects and/or slow devices, the
 *     difference is negligible.

 *
 *      This function is only used in conjunction with reliable OBEX sessions.
 *      When using reliable OBEX sessions, OBEX will maintain an offset into
 *      the current object being processed. In the case of an unexpected

 *      have been processed before the connection ended, OBEX will have to
 *      reset the object offset on OBEX packet boundaries. This may result
 *      in the reading or writing of a portion of duplicate data.
 *
 * Requires:
 *      OBEX_SESSION_SUPPORT set to XA_ENABLED.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      obs - pointer to the handle of the object store entry. Casting from

/****************************************************************************
 *
 * Section: Transport Flow Control API
 *
 ****************************************************************************
 *
 *     The OBEX Transport provides a set of functions which enable an
 *     application to manage receive flow control at the transport
 *     layer using native transport specific flow control methods. There are
 *     three functions which were created specifically for this purpose:
 *
 *     OBEX_IsRxFlowAvailable() is used to determine if transport layer
 *         flow control is available.
 *
 *     OBEX_PauseRxFlow() is used to exert flow control to stop the remote
 *         peer from sending data.
 *
 *     OBEX_ResumeRxFlow() is used to resume a previously paused connection.
 *
 *     A fourth function OBEX_GetTpConnInfo() is used in conjunction with the
 *     flow control API to retrieve the buffering requirements necessary to
 *     determine when flow control must be exerted and relieved.
 *
 *     Transport flow control can be managed from two perspectives, depending
 *     on your receive buffer arrangement. By calling OBEX_GetTpConnInfo()
 *     the application is informed of the minimum number of receive buffers
 *     and of what size are necessary to store maximum amount of data that
 *     can be received after flow control is exerted via OBEX_PauseRxFlow().
 *     If one contiguous receive buffer is used, its minimum size can be
 *     calculated by multiplying the number of receive buffers by the PDU
 *     size "ObexTpConnInfo.minRxBuffs * ObexTpConnInfo.maxPduSize". Note
 *     that acceptable estimates of these values can be made at compile time.
 *     The minRxBuffs value will be <= OBEX_PERFORMANCE_MULTIPLIER
 *     configuration option. The maxPduSize value will be <= the transports
 *     PDU size. The configuration option OBEX_TX_BUFF_SIZE is usually
 *     equivalent to the PDU size of the largest transport (unless it is
 *     overridden with a smaller value).
 *
 *     OBEX Transport Flow Control affects all OBEX PDU's. But not all PDU's
 *     contain data destined for the Object Store. An application should not
 *     base their flow off/on decisions on counting received buffers or bytes
 *     and comparing them to the values returned from OBEX_GetTpConnInfo().
 *     Instead flow off/on decisions should be based on available receive
 *     buffer space. Once it drops below "ObexTpConnInfo.minRxBuffs" flow
 *     should be paused using OBEX_PauseRxFlow(). As receive buffers become
 *     available again, their number should be compared to
 *     "ObexTpConnInfo.minRxBuffs" once their count meets or exceeds this
 *     value OBEX_Resume_RxFlow() should be called. This cycle should repeat
 *     until the exchange is complete.
 *
 *     The flow control state is only reset by OBEX when a new connection is
 *     received. For this reason, applications receiving multiple operations
 *     must preserve their receive state across operations. So if flow was
 *     paused and then the operation completed, the next operation may not
 *     start because flow control is exerted. Again, if flow is resumed
 *     when the necessary receive buffers are available new operations will
 *     proceed normally.
 *
 *     Finally, note that some transports may have limited or no support for
 *     transport layer flow control. For this reason OBEX Packet based flow
 *     control should be considered a better alternative.

 *
 ****************************************************************************
 *
 *     The OBEX Reliable Session component provides a set of functions which
 *     enable functionality in OBEX to perform reliable operations.  In this
 *     way, if an operation is interrupted by a transport disconnection, OBEX
 *     can be resumed to the exact position where the disconnect took place.
 *     Once the transport connection is reestablished and the OBEX Resume
 *     command is issued, all OBEX connections will be restored along with
 *     any operation that may have been in progress at the time the transport
 *     disconnection occurred.
 *
 *     Applications and services must save their own context in order to
 *     resume a session. The OBEX layer does not know how commands such as
 *     PUT, GET, SETPATH, etc are used by the application/service so it cannot
 *     save context for them. If the OBEX layer and/or applications are
 *     shut down while a session is suspended then the context must be saved
 *     in a persistent data store if resuming the session later is desired.
 *
 *     Several functions provide the OBEX Reliable Session behavior:
 *
 *     OBEX_ClientCreateSession() is used to create a reliable session.
 *
 *     OBEX_ClientCloseSession() is used to close a reliable session. This
 *         function can be used to close both an active and a suspended
 *         session. When the active session is closed, the unreliable session
 *         becomes active.
 *
 *     OBEX_ClientSuspendSession() is used to suspend a reliable session. A
 *         suspended session may be closed or resumed.  However, if the
 *         suspend timeout expires, the session should be closed locally.
 *         When the active session is suspended, the unreliable session
 *         becomes active.
 *
 *     OBEX_ClientResumeSession() is used to resume a suspended reliable
 *         session.
 *
 *     OBEX_ClientSetSessionTimeout() is used to set the client's suspend
 *         timeout value. The suspend timeout used is the minimum of the
 *         client and server's requested values.
 *
 *     OBEX_ServerSetSessionTimeout() is used to set the server's suspend
 *         timeout value. The suspend timeout used is the minimum of the
 *         client and server's requested values.
 *
 *     OBEX_ServerAcceptSession() is used to accept the current session
 *         operation. This function provides a new or matching session when
 *         the OBSE_PROVIDE_SESSION event is received.
 *
 *     OBEX_CreateSessionId() is a utility function used to generate session
 *         identifier values. It is used to compute the session id from an
 *         OBEX Session structure when closing and resuming a session.

 * OBEX_ClientResumeSession()
 *
 *     Performs the OBEX "Resume Session" operation. The resume session
 *     command has two components. If the session was suspended gracefully
 *     (via a Suspend Session command) then only the session needs to be
 *     resumed. If the session was suspended because of a transport link
 *     disconnect, then there may have been an operation in progress when
 *     the suspend occurred. In this case, once the session is resumed the
 *     operation will automatically be resumed. The parameters necessary
 *     to resume a suspended operation are provided in the ResumeParms
 *     parameter.
 *
 * Requires:
 *     OBEX_SESSION_SUPPORT set to XA_ENABLED.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     ObexApp - The Application Handle provided during init.
 *
 *     Session - Session to resume.  The application must provide a valid
 *         session that has already been created and is suspended.
 *
 *     ResumeParms - If the session being resumed was suspended while an
 *         operation was in progress, the information indicated in the
 *         "u.suspended" structure must be provided here. When resuming
 *         such a session, the operation that was suspended will
 *         automatically resume immediately after the session resume
 *         command completes. An OBCE_RESUME_OPER event will be indicated
 *         to mark the resumption of the operation. The completion of the
 *         resumed operation will be indicated with an OBCE_COMPLETE
 *         or OBCE_ABORTED event. If resume headers are provided with
 *         this structure, the ownership of the memory is transferred to
 *         OBEX until the resume session command completes. If a resume
 *         object store handle is provided with this structure, the handle
 *         is kept by OBEX until the resumed operation is complete.
 *
 *     Timeout - Session suspend timeout (in milliseconds).  Use 0xFFFFFFFF
 *         for an infinite timeout and 0x00 to use the current timeout.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     OB_STATUS_PENDING - Operation was successfully started. Completion
 *         will be signaled via a call to the ObClientAppCb callback. If
 *         the completion status is OBCE_ABORTED the session was not resumed
 *         and the unreliable session is still the active session.
 *
 *     OB_STATUS_FAILED - Operation failed.
 *
 *     OB_STATUS_BUSY - Operation was not started because the client
 *         is currently executing another operation or there is
 *         already an active reliable session.
 *
 *     OB_STATUS_NO_CONNECT - Operation was not started because
 *         the client is not connected.
 *
 *     OB_STATUS_PACKET_TOO_SMALL - Operation was not started
 *         because the OBEX packet size was insufficient to transmit
 *         the provided headers.
 *
 *     OB_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - A parameter is invalid.
