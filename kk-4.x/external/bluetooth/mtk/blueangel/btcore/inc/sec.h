/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SEC_RegisterPairingHandler()
 *
 *     Register the handler that will handle all pairing.  This 
 *     handler is called when pairing is required. Pairing occurs 
 *     for two reasons. The first is when a device initiates the 
 *     bonding procedure. The second is when authentication is
 *     required and a link does not exist. 
 *
 *     If no handler is set (handler == 0) then the pairing
 *     procedure will fail. This function is used to set pairable
 *     mode. The old handler is returned when the function is 
 *     called.
 *
 *     The pairing handler is called with the following events:
 *
 *     BTEVENT_PIN_REQ - If "errCode" is BEC_NO_ERROR, this event
 *     indicates a PIN code is needed. The handler provides a PIN
 *     code by calling SEC_SetPin. If "errCode" is NOT BEC_NO_ERROR,
 *     this event indicates a previous authentication request has
 *     been cancelled.
 *
 *     BTEVENT_PAIRING_COMPLETE - This event indicates that pairing
 *     has completed successfully and the link is authenticated.
 *     The "errCode" field of the BtEvent indicates the status of
 *     storing the link key. If pairing fails no event will be 
 *     sent (there is no event sent by the radio module indicating 
 *     failure).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     handler - pointer to the handler for dealing with pairing.
 *         This handler can be a registered global handler but does
 *         not have to be.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     Pointer to the old handler.
 */
BtHandler *SEC_RegisterPairingHandler(BtHandler *handler);

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SEC_RegisterAuthorizeHandler()
 *
 *     Register the handler that will handle all authorization.  
 *     This handler is called when authorization is needed as
 *     part of security level 2.  
 *
 *     If no handler is set (handler == 0) then the authorization
 *     procedure will fail. 
 *
 *     The authorization handler is called with the following events:
 *
 *     BTEVENT_AUTHORIZATION_REQ - If "errCode" is BEC_NO_ERROR, this event
 *     indicates a request for authorization. The link needing authorization
 *     is passed in the "remDev" field of BtEvent. During the callback, the
 *     handler can call SEC_GetSecurityRecord to obtain more information on
 *     what service or channel is being authorized. If "errCode" is NOT
 *     BEC_NO_ERROR, this event indicates a previous authorization request
 *     has been cancelled.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     handler - pointer to the handler for dealing with 
 *         authorization.  This handler can be a registered global 
 *         handler or even the same handler that does pairing but it
 *         does not have to be.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     Pointer to the old handler.

 * SEC_AccessRequest()
 *
 *     Determine if access is allowed for the device specified
 *     by rm at the protocol specified by id for the given
 *     channel. The incoming parameter indicates if the request
 *     is incoming or outgoing.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     token - pointer to a Security token. The fields of the
 *         token must be filled in appropriately. If BT_STATUS_PENDING
 *         is returned the token cannot be modified until the protocol's
 *         callback is called.
 *     
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - Access is approved
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The operation has started. The results
 *         will be returned via the protocol's callback identified by
 *         id. The callback is called with "eventType"
 *         BTEVENT_ACCESS_APPROVED or BTEVENT_ACCESS_DENIED.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_FAILED - Access is denied.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - Access is denied. Token is not
 *         properly initialized, token is 0 (XA_ERROR_CHECK only)
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_HCI_INIT_ERR - operation failed because the HCI has
 *         an initialization error. Monitor the global events to

 * SEC_Authorize()
 *
 *     If "isAuthorized" is set to TRUE then temporary authorization

 * SEC_AuthorizeService()
 *
 *     SEC_AuthorizeService is similar to SEC_Authorize, but temporarily
 *     authorizes a device for a specific service or channel. If
 *     "isAuthorized" is set to TRUE then temporary authorization 
 *     for a service is granted to the remote device, otherwise it

 * SEC_AuthenticateLink()
 *
 *     Authenticate an existing link with a remote device. If

 *
 *     If the operation is successful then BTEVENT_AUTHENTICATED will
 *     be sent to all registered global handlers and all handlers
 *     bound to the remote device structure. Note that this event does not
 *     occur if the remote device initiated an authentication operation
 *     because authentication is a one-way operation.
 *
 *     The link must be active (not in hold, sniff, park or in the
 *     process of being disconnected). Also it must not already

 *
 * Parameters:
 *     handler - handler to receive authenticate results. This can

 *      
 *     The link must be active (not in hold, sniff, park or in the
 *     process of being disconnected). Also it must not already
 *     be in the process of performing an encryption operation.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     handler - handler to receive encryption results. This can
 *         be the registered global handler or a handler bound to
 *         a remote device or 0. Failures are sent to this handler
 *         only. The handler can be 0 if desired, though no handler

 *
 *     remDev - pointer to remote device structure. 
 *
 *     mode - desired encryption mode (enabled or disabled)
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - the operation was started successfully.
 *         When the operation is complete the handler will be
 *         called with the BTEVENT_ENCRYPT_COMPLETE event.
 *         A BTEVENT_HCI_FATAL_ERROR event indicates a fatal radio
 *         or HCI transport error and all pending operations have failed.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - the link is already in the desired mode.
 *         No events will be generated.

 *     enable is successful but setting encryption mode fails the 
 *     operation is still successful. The "p.secMode.encrypt" field
 *     shows the status of the encryption mode setting. TRUE means
 *     that encryption mode is active FALSE means it is not active.
 *
 *     If the operation is successful (as defined above) then all 
 *     registered global handlers will receive BTEVENT_SECURITY_CHANGE

 * SEC_EnumDeviceRecords()
 *
 *     Enumerate the device database. The first record is at index 0. The
 *     intent of this function is to enumerate all records in the device
 *     database in a loop. If records are added or deleted in between calls
 *     to this function then all records may not be returned or duplicate
 *     records could be returned.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     i - index of desired record. The first record is at index 0.
 *
 *     record - pointer to location to receive record.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - operation is successful. 
 *         Record is returned
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_FAILED - operation failed. No record is
 *         returned. This occurs if the index is greater than
 *         the number of records or an error occurred in reading
 *         the database.
