 * AT Handsfree Command Processor API layer
 *
 * The AT Command Processor API provides functions for both parsing and 
 * encoding AT commands and responses.  It is modularized into components
 * that support Headset, Hands-free, and DUN profiles.  It also provides
 * the ability to parse and encode Phonebook commands and responses, based
 * on the GSM specifications.  Support for SMS messaging commands will
 * be added in the future.
 *
 * The Hands-free Command Processor module provides the commands necessary
 * for the Hands-free Profile.  It supports commands for all specification
 * versions up to 1.5.

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AT_MapHfIndicators()
 *
 *     This function is used to create a mapping table that matches the remote
 *     device indicators to the locally supported indicators.
 *
 * Requires:
 *     AT_ROLE_TERMINAL be enabled.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     Known - Table of indicators supported locally. The table is terminated
 *         with a null entry. All indicator table entries must be in upper
 *         case, matching will be performed case insensitively.
 *     
 *     Map - Table that receives mapping information. Upon completion the
 *         expression Map[<remote indicator> - 1] will return the matching
 *         local indicator index into "Known". One must be subtracted from
 *         the remote indicator value because indicators are one based. This
 *         table must have the same number of entries as the "Known" table.
 *         If a Map table entry contains 0xff, the indicator is not supported
 *         by the remote device.
 *
 *     Remote - A pointer to an AtHandsfreeResult structure that represents
 *         the remote devices indicators.
 *
 * Returns:
