 * HID_CloseConnection()
 *
 *     Closes an HID connection between two devices.  When the connection

 *
 *     If there are outstanding transactions or interrupts when a connection is 
 *     closed, an event will be received by the application for each one.  The 
 *     "status" field for these events will be set to BT_STATUS_NO_CONNECTION.
 *
