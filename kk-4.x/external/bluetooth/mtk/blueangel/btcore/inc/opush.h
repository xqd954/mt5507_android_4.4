 * Object Push Profile (OPush) Layer 
 *
 *     The OPUSH layer provides two levels of service for applications
 *     implementing the Object Push profile. The basic service provides
 *     functions for registering the OPush SDP entries and for building
 *     OPush SDP queries. These functions can be used directly with the
 *     OBEX API. The expanded services include functions for building
 *     and sending OPush compliant messages.

 *
 *     If this operation fails due to a failure in adding queued headers
 *     (GOEP_ClientQueueHeader), it may be useful to set the "More" parameter

 *     also force the GET request to not send the final bit. This allows
 *     subsequent GET request packets to send additional headers prior to a 
 *     GET response sending back the object being described in the GET request 
 *     headers.  Any additional headers that cannot fit in the initial GET 
 *     request will be sent when OPUSH_ClientContinue is called during the 
 *     GOEP_EVENT_CONTINUE.  GOEP_ClientQueueHeader should be called before or 
 *     during this event to ensure they are sent in the next GET request packet.
 *     
 * Parameters:
 *     Client - The client application's registration structure.
 *
 *     Object - Parameters necessary to build a pull request. This
 *         parameter must be provided.

 * Returns:

 *         will be signaled via an event to the application callback.
