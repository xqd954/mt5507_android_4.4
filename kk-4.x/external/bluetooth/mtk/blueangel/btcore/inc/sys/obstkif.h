 * OBEX Transport Adapter API layer
 *
 *     This layer defines calls made by the OBEX layer to control a
 *     specific transport adapter. Transport adapters implement this API
 *     by filling a table of functions (ObTransFuncTable) and providing that
 *     table to the OBEX layer in an ObexTransport structure as documented
 *     here.
 *
 *     The OBEX layer uses this API to send data through a transport,
 *     handle flow control, initiate disconnections, and get other
 *     information from the transport.
 *
 *     Each transport adapter must implement this API.

 * OBTRANS_Disconnect() type
 * 
 *     A function of this type is exported by OBEX transport adapter
 *     in the ObTransFuncTable. It is used by the OBEX protocol to disconnect
 *     the transport connection.
 *
 *     This function is only used internally (by the OBEX protocol). It
 *     should always disconnect the link without performing any of the 
 *     safety checks that are common in User API functions. Such checks
 *     include; checking for a bound client, for an operation in progress,
 *     etc. This function can be used to disconnect both client and server
 *     transport connections.
 *
 *     The transport is required to notify the protocol when the disconnect
 *     is complete by calling the OBPROT_Disconnected() function.
 *
 *     Currently the return status must be set to OB_STATUS_PENDING.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     TiContext - transport instance context provided to the
 *         OBEX Protocol layer during transport linking.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     OB_STATUS_SUCCESS - The specified connection has been disconnected.
 *
 *     OB_STATUS_PENDING - The specified connection is in the process of
 *         being disconnected. Completion must be signaled by a call to
 *         OBPROT_Disconnected().
 *
 *     OB_STATUS_xxxxxxx - The specified connection could not be disconnected.

 *
 * Parameters:
 *     TiContext - transport instance context provided to the
 *         OBEX Protocol layer during transport linking.
 *
 * Returns:

 * OBTRANS_SendTxBuffer() type
 *
 *     A function of this type is exported by OBEX transport adapter

 *
 *     The transmit buffer provided can be converted to an ObexPacket
 *     by using the ContainingRecord() function. It is the responsibility
 *     of this function to return the buffer to the OBEX Protocol layer,
 *     regardless of the return value. The buffer is returned by calling
 *     OBPROT_TxDone() when the transmit has completed successfully.
 *     Or by calling OBPROT_ReturnTxBuffer() in the case of a failure.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     TiContext - transport instance context provided to the
 *         OBEX Protocol layer during transport linking.
 *
 *     TxBuffer - Pointer to data to transmit.
 *
 *     TxLen - Length of data.
 *
 * Returns:
